// This code creates a timeline with default animation parameters using the anime.timeline() function from the Anime.js library. The timeline is then populated with three animation objects that animate the translateX property of three elements with the classes square, circle, and triangle to a value of 250. These animations will be executed in sequence, with the next animation starting after the previous one has completed. The easing property is set to easeOutExpo, which will give the animations a smooth, accelerating curve, and the duration property is set to 750, which determines how long the animations will take to complete.
